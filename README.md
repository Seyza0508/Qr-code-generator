# Qr-code-generator
This Python script utilizes the qrcode library to generate a QR code for a specific URL. The script configures the QR code with parameters like size, error correction level, box size, and border. It then encodes the URL 'https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/CalcIII.aspx' into the QR code. The make(fit=True) method optimizes the QR code size based on the data, ensuring a compact representation. Finally, the script creates an image of the QR code with a black foreground and red background and saves it as 'testQR.png.' This example illustrates a simple yet effective way to create and customize QR codes in Python, which applies to various applications, including web linking and information sharing.
